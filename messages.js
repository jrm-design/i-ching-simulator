  fullStaticHexagram: "Without changing lines, Creative Power is a deeply significant omen. The trigram, Ch'ien, creativity, is repeated above and below. What you create now will be the basis and inspiration for what you experience next. As a result of any action you now take, your fate will be sealed. You may always trace back to the beginning but there will never be an end to what you are about to set into motion.",

  changingLine2: "Take note of a person who is active in the field of your interest. Although he may not be in a position of Creative Power, his conduct is above reproach and therefore he has significant influence. It would be to your advantage to align yourself with him.",
  changingLine3: "A new world of Creative Power is opening to you. Others will become aware of this and attach themselves to you in hopes that they may use your gain in influence for their own aims. There is danger in this, for your energies may become distracted before they are stablized. If you hold fiercely to your vision and integrity you will be protected.",
  changingLine4: "A time of choice is at hand. Because of an amplification in your Creative power you must decide whether to enter the public eye and serve society, or whether to withdraw and work on your inner development. Follow your deepest intution and you will not make a mistake.",
  changingLine5: "Whatever you choose to do is in accord with the cosmos. Your thinking is clearheaded. Because of this your influence is great and your milieu will look to you for inspiration.",
  changingLine6: "Your ambitions far exceed the possibilities of your Creative Power. If ou pursue this dream you will lose touch with reality and lose contact with your community. You will no longer know how to behave appropriately and will ultimately regret your actions."
